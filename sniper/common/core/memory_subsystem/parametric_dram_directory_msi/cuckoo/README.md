## How to run

1) make
2) ./elastic_cuckoo ${#ways} ${size} ${hash_func} ${type} ${scheme} ${occupancy_thr} ${scale_factor} ${swaps} ${priority}

Parameters:
1) ways: number of ways/nests >2
2) size: size of each way
3) hash_func: string of the hash function name to be used {city,blake2}
4) type: type of cuckoo hashtable {elastic, regular}
5) scheme: resizing method for the elastic cuckoo hashtable {oneshot, dynamic}
6) occupancy_thr: threshold to trigger resizing 
7) swaps: number of elements to be rehashed
8) priority: bias a hashtable during insertion

## Hash functions

1) Blake2 from https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2
2) CityHash from https://github.com/google/cityhash

## Notes
The purpose of this code is to demonstrate some of the characteristics of (elastic) cuckoo hashing and it has not been optimized for performance.
